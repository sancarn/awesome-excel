A curated list of awesome Microsoft Excel resources - This is heavily WIP, so please feel free to contribute / upload ideas to issues!

## Symbology

Because of the nature of Excel, sometimes businesses have made commercial addins, meaning not all of these resources are free. Additionally, some resources might be password protected. As such we utilise the following symbols to denote the status of the resource.

[o_paid]: ./resources/Money.svg
[o_pass]: ./resources/Padlock.svg "Spreadsheet is passwordprotected"

- [![o_pass]](#-) - Workbook is password protected.
- [![o_paid]](#- "Link includes/leads to paid content") - Link includes/leads to paid content
